# Roadmap for improvement 
## I want to style the background of the site. Adding columns to the sides of the site and adding a color pallet to the columns and backgound. I also want to add a reset button and maybe a record of wins. The reset button would just reset the board without the need to use the refresh button and with no need to refresh i can bank the wins and display them.
